R-Play
======

This is a project to make an open source web based StarCraft 2 replay analysis
tool. It relies on `GraylinKim's`_ `sc2reader`_ to actually get the data out of
the replays.

This project was started by and so far mostly written by `Issac Kelly`_, I
(`Wraithan`_) have taken over this project due to time constraints on Issac and
hope to carry it forward.

If you have ideas for data that would be useful to you for determining what you
need to work on, please check to see if it is already reported in the `issues`_,
if not please report it `here`_.
